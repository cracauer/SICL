(cl:in-package #:cleavir-hir-transformations)

;;;; This transformation replaces every LOAD-TIME-VALUE-INPUT in the
;;;; program by a lexical location.  A form is appended to the forms
;;;; of the TOP-LEVEL-ENTER-INSTRUCTION for each LOAD-TIME-VALUE-INPUT
;;;; and the lexical location is added to the outputs of the initial
;;;; TOP-LEVEL-ENTER-INSTRUCTION.
;;;;
;;;; If the LOAD-TIME-VALUE-INPUT to be replaced has a form of type
;;;; (QUOTE constant), then CONVERT-CONSTANT-TO-IMMEDIATE is called,
;;;; passing the constant and the SYSTEM as arguments.  If that call
;;;; returns an integer, then instead of adding a form to the initial
;;;; instruction, this transformation replaces the input by an
;;;; immediate input instead.  If that call returns NIL, the normal
;;;; transformation is performed.
;;;;
;;;; Client code can add a method on CONVERT-CONSTANT-TO-IMMEDIATE
;;;; that should then specialize on the second parameter, i.e. the
;;;; SYSTEM.
