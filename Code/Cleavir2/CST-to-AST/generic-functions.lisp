;;; Generic function CONVERT-FUNCTION-REFERENCE.
;;;
;;; This generic function converts a reference to a function given by
;;; a description in the form of an INFO instance.  That INFO instance
;;; was obtained as a result of a form such as (FUNCTION
;;; FUNCTION-NAME) by calling FUNCTION-INFO with an environment and
;;; the FUNCTION-NAME argument.  The function signals an error if the
;;; INFO instance is not a GLOBAL-FUNCTION-INFO or a
;;; LOCAL-FUNCTION-INFO.  Client code can override the default
;;; behavior by adding methods to this function, specialized to the
;;; particular client defined by that client code.

;;; Returns up to two values, where the first value is a list of equal
;;; keys, and where the second value is a list of equalp keys.
;;;
;;; Two objects o1 and o2 are considered similar if their equal keys have a
;;; common element in the sense of EQUAL, or if their equalp keys have a
;;; common element in the sense of EQUALP.  Clients that want to write
;;; additional methods for this function are encouraged to have a look at
;;; the auxiliary functions EQUAL-REPRESENTATION and EQUALP-REPRESENTATION.

;;; STRUCTURE-OBJECT, or CONDITION.
