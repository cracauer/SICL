;;; The rack of every general instance has a prefix that contains
;;; information about the rack, as opposed to the contents of the
;;; object it represents.  For a general instance that is not an
;;; array, that prefix consists of 2 words, where the first word is
;;; the stamp and the second words contains a list of effective slot
;;; definitions.  For simple arrays, the prefix contains the stamp and
;;; a list of dimensions.  Other arrays contain information about fill
;;; pointers and displacement.  This function takes an integer
;;; representing the number of words in this prefix, and it returns an
;;; immediate input with an offset corresponding to those words,
;;; i.e. the argument multiplied by 8 minus the tag value of a rack
;;; pointer, which is 7.
