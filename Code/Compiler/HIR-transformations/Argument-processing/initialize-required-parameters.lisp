;;; This function takes two arguments.  The first argument must be a
;;; non-empty list of lexical locations corresponding to the required
;;; parameters of a function.  The second argument must be a lexical
;;; location that holds the dynamic environment in which this code is
;;; to be executed.
;;;
;;; This function creates a chain of ARGUMENT-INSTRUCTIONs, each one
;;; initializing a single lexical location for one parameter.

;;; This function returns two values, the first and the last
;;; instruction in the chain.
