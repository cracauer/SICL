\chapter{The \texttt{format} function}

The directory \texttt{Code/Format} contains a near-complete
implementation of the \texttt{format} function.  What is missing is
the printers for floating-point numbers.  Also, the \texttt{formatter}
function is not yet implemented.

We are planning to use the method created by Adams
\cite{Adams:2018:RFF:3296979.3192369} for printing floating-point
numbers.
