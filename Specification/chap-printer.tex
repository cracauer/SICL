\chapter{Printer}

A large part of the printer can be written portably without
performance penalty.  We intend to supply standard methods for
\texttt{print-object}, and code for functions such as \texttt{princ},
\texttt{prin1}, and \texttt{print}. 

Initially, we were planning to use the method created by Burger and Dybvig
\cite{Burger:1996:PFN:231379.231397} to print floating-point numbers
so that they can be read back to the exact same number.  But more
recent work \cite{Adams:2018:RFF:3296979.3192369} claims even better
techniques.  We need to compare these new techniques.
