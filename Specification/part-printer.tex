\chapter{Printer}

A large part of the printer can be written portably without
performance penalty.  We intend to supply standard methods for
\texttt{print-object}, and code for functions such as \texttt{princ},
\texttt{prin1}, and \texttt{print}. 

We are planning to use the method created by Adams
\cite{Adams:2018:RFF:3296979.3192369} for printing floating-point
numbers so that they can be read back to the exact same number.
